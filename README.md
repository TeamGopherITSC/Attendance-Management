# Attendance-Management
Attendance Management System Project

Purpose:
The core reason for this documentation is to describe the requirements needed for the development of the software Attendance Management System. It is made for every company that is using the product, in order for the companies to know how the software really function and to use it to it full potential. 
This Software has many uses from checking absentees to calculating payroll by deducting the days absent. 
 
General Aim:
The aim of this document is to provide an elaborate and meticulous description of the requirements and the specifications of the Attendance Management system.  

Specific Aim:
The specific goals are as follows: 
• Describing the scope and goals of the software. 
• Serving as a reference for software designers. 
• Serving as a structure and model for use cases. 
• Serving as a platform for ongoing refinement 
 
1.2 Scope 
The working name of the current system (in production), as decided by a majority vote of all parties involved is Generation. Note the assigned name is subject to change.  
The Generation attendance management system suite will be herein now referred to as the software. 
The system is aimed at providing a fully functional attendance management system for mid-high tier organizations. 
General Features (Application) 
• Recording and keeping track of employee attendance. 
✓ The recording will be conducted in a fashion similar to clocking in and out on traditional management systems, where upon user authentication the employee will be prompted to check in and that time is stamped as the user check-in time. Now the user will have to check out later or the day will be marked as absent. 
• Providing attendance records to different entities at different capacities. (administrator and employee). 
• A payroll management program that will work in tandem with the other programs in the suite to provide a seamless interface from which to conduct professional work. 
✓ The Payroll manager will be fed information from the attendance manager as well as the leave manager and upon simple calculation will arrive at the salaries that are to be issued to the employees. It will be in contact with employees in a read only interface that will show how the calculation for their salaries came about, this will ensure transparency and will limit human interaction. There are no present plans to incorporate a verification system for the alpha version in case of errors, however there are plans in the future for such an upgrade.

Note Worthy Specific Features 
• Encrypted authentication system that will serve as the gateway to the software.  A combination of a password (Min-8 characters) and a user name will serve as the access point for all parties be it administrator or employee.  
• Leave manager that is dynamic and fully integrated with the software that will notify users of various information related to leave upon prompt. 
• A payroll manager that will enable instant calculation of employee salaries, provide that information to employees and do miscellaneous work like payment docking. 

By incorporating these features, the software will achieve the following: 
• Near Complete elimination of paper work. 
• Minimizing human oversight. 
• Greater Data Accuracy and Reliability 
• Simplifies the entire process. 
• Greater security to attendance and payroll data 

The scope Attendance Management System is very clear and precise, As the name suggests it is used for getting attendance in a company where attending to work is a necessity, you can use it by giving the employee a username and Id then when they come to work every day, they will login and check in for work. It also has the following features: 
-It allows the manager to directly talk to specific employee 
-It has a notice board that is accessible by any person which uses the software as it shows departments which needs new employee. 
-It allows an employee to ask for leave and can be notified there when the manager gives answer and he/she also can see how many leave days he/she has used and how many more he/she has left to use. 
-It allows the administrator to easily control the progress of the employee daily. 
-It allows the employee to update the administrator of his/her work progress. 
-It also has a check out function which records your check out time and compare your check in and check out time finally giving the hours you worked on that specific day. Using this many data can be obtained about the two most essential attribute of an employee which is punctuality and honesty. 
-The software automatically generates a graphical data for each employee recorded in the software after the session is over. 
-The administrator has the privilege of accessing every information about the employee there is to access in workplace and therefore to study the history of the employee. 
-Being said above it might worry the user about privacy but, it uses username and password to get accessed so by another person, so it has a very good security. 

What the Software will not deliver? 
The software will not completely eliminate human oversight, as an administrator with minimal IT training is needed to oversee the system.  
The alpha version of the software will not provide real time tracking as the hardware to implement such features is not presently accessible to us. 
The software is also not completely user tampering proof as the measures that we are going to implement to mitigate that issue are not omnipotent. For instance, the system in its current form cannot stop users from checking in or checking out for other users if they have their credentials. 
The software in its current form cannot offer other employment management services, it does not allow the storage of information apart from attendance records.  There are plans to upgrade the system to a full employee management system with functionality for human resources. The current system has a payroll management, attendance management, leave management systems however it lacks appraisal management and employee management which makes it fall short of a full Human Resource management system.
